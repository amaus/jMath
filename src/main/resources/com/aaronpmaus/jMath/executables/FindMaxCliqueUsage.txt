Usage: FindMaxClique [<options>] <graph fname>

  FindMaxClique takes the file name of a DIMACS file specifying a graph
  and solves and prints the MAX CLIQUE in that graph. The user can
  specify which algorithm to use.

  The inc-adapter algorithm is an adapter to Li, Fang, and Xu's
  Incremental Max Clique program (Combining MaxSAT Reasoning and
  Incremental Upper Bound for the Maximum Clique Problem, 2013 IEEE
  International Conference on Tools  with Artificial Intelligence). The
  inc-solver algorithm is this library's implementation of that
  algorithm. This implementation is in progress. The maus algorithm is
  an original algorithm for this library. It is not as efficient the
  Incremental Max Clique algorithms.
